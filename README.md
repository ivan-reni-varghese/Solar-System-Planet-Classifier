# Solar-System-Planets-Classifier
This repository contains the model that I built for classifying the planets, dwarf planets and Earth's moon in the Solar System.

# Models Used :
- Custom-made Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Random Forest

CNN alone gives good accuracy when there is sufficient data to be trained on. When the data is insufficient, random forest can be plugged in along with CNN to boost the accuracy of the model.
